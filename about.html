            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>QGLegacy was founded by long-time friends Qilot and Ghost, who share a deep passion for gaming. What began as casual conversations grew into a shared goal of creating something impactful. Driven by our vision and determination, we took the plunge into game/web development. The name "QGLegacy" represents our combined identities and our commitment to building a legacy together. Weâ€™re thrilled to bring players an experience filled with creativity, fun, and endless possibilities. Thank you for joining us on this journey!</p>
